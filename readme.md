Around
======

A simple campfire bot written in Go.

This is a dummy project to get used to Go. I'm pretty sure you will find some of the most retarded code I've written
all year and it's september so I've managed to write quite a bit of crap code by now.

This uses the around api to do stuff I can't figure out how to do in Go yet. (I've been coding in it for 4 hours give me
a break.)
