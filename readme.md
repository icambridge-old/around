Around
======

A simple campfire bot written in Go.

This is a dummy project to get used to Go. I'm pretty sure you will find some of the most retarded code I've written
all year and it's september so I've managed to write quite a bit of crap code by now.

# Dependencies

This uses the around api to do stuff I can't figure out how to do in Go yet. (I've been coding in it for 4 hours give me
a break.)

# Disclaimer

I'm too lazy to fix the reason why the company Jenkins won't install the campfire notification so this is just a work
around. It's actually less effort to do this also I ties in with me playing with Go. So no I'm not that retarded that I
don't know about the campfire jenkins plugin.
